# About Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service
Focus on writing code, not deploying it. Don’t stress about the journey, just enjoy the destination. Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service will take care of the rest with declarative deployments to Kubernetes using the GitOps experience you love. Write your code, package your artifacts, declare your application targets, and commit with confidence. 

# Top 3 Selling Points 

* *Multi-Environment Deployments:* Deploy your code to multiple environments with ease, track where your code has reached and what needs to happen; only deploy to production if pre-production security scanners and automated tests complete successfully, and leverage your existing test suites during a deployment to verify application health.
* *Start Deploying In Under 10 Minutes:* Connect your Kubernetes cluster and deploy our sample application to it using a canary strategy in under 10 minutes. Deploy your own custom application in under an hour.
* *Multiple Cloud Providers:* Whether you’re running in AWS, Azure, building software in Google, or use a multi-target approach with all three, Armory has you covered. Deploy the code you are building to any cluster, namespace; any or all k8s environments, at any scale, in a public cloud or your on premise data center.
